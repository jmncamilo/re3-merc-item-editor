# RE3 - Mercenaries Item Editor byMystic

Edit the starting items for characters in Mercenaries mode in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999) [PC] SourceNext version.

## ðŸ“– Introduction

Have you ever wished *Carlos, Mikhail,* and *Nicholai* had access to different weapons or items in the **original** Resident Evil 3's Mercenaries mode? Well, with this tool you can make it happen. Simply load your game's .exe file to modify the inventory of each character.

>*It's important to note that this tool is only compatible with the SourceNext PC version of the game. It has been specifically tested with the SourceNext Official 1.1.0 patch, but it may also work with the original release. For the easiest experience, I recommend applying the Resident Evil 3 Classic [REbirth patch](https://classicrebirth.com/index.php/downloads/resident-evil-3-classic-rebirth/) to your SourceNext version.*
