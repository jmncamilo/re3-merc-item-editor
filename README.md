# RE3 - Mercenaries Item Editor byMystic

Edit the starting items for characters in Mercenaries mode in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999) [PC] SourceNext version.

## üìñ Introduction

Have you ever wished *Carlos, Mikhail,* and *Nicholai* had access to different weapons or items in the **original** Resident Evil 3's Mercenaries mode? Well, with this tool you can make it happen. Simply load your game's .exe file to modify the inventory of each character.

>*It's important to note that this tool is only compatible with the SourceNext PC version of the game. It has been specifically tested with the SourceNext Official 1.1.0 patch, but it may also work with the original release. For the easiest experience, I recommend applying the Resident Evil 3 Classic [REbirth patch](https://classicrebirth.com/index.php/downloads/resident-evil-3-classic-rebirth/) to your SourceNext version.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

The first thing you need to do is download the tool [here](https://github.com/jmncamilo/re3-merc-item-editor/releases/download/v1.0.1/MercenariesItemEditor.zip).

Tool is a .JAR executable, that means you need to have Java installed on your computer. If you're not familiar with Java and don't have it installed, simply [click here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk23-archive-downloads.html).

The link will take you to Oracle's website to download Java. Look for the *"Java SE Development Kit 23.0.1"*. Why this one? Because it is the specific version I used to build the project, so it should work perfectly!

Next, find your operating system in the list under *"Product / File Description"*. Click the link next to it to start the download. Once the file is downloaded, just run it like you would any other program. It should install without any issues, but if you run into any trouble, let me know and I'll be happy to help.

And that's it! You've successfully installed Java on your computer. Now you can run the .JAR file without any problems.
